# Algorithmic Pricing and Collusion: DQN Market Simulation

This is a Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for studying algorithmic collusion within oligopolistic markets.

## üí° Academic Background

- As AI increasingly powers pricing algorithms in digital markets, a critical question emerges: **Can pricing algorithms learn to collude spontaneously?**

- Specifically, this question asks when pricing agents interact repeatedly in market, whether they could coordinate on higher prices for maxmizing long-term profits without huamn intervention in this process?

- In a computational experiment, Calvano et al (2020) have found that basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Q-learning are able to independently learn collusive pricing strategies and achieve supra-competitive profits even without explicit communication.

- However, Q-learning algorithm is primitive in reinforcement learning. It suffers from some technical limitations.
  - Tabular learning method (Q-table) is inefficient or infeasible when state-action space is very large or continuous, making it difficult to simulate the complexity of real market.
  - Sequential parameter updates make the learning samples temporally related, which likely to cause high bias in this experiment.

- For better market simulation, it's necessary to extend this study to more advanced and powerful RL algorithms.

## ü§ñ Algorithm Framework: Deep Q-network
Deep Q-network (DQN) is a value-based RL algorithm that extends Q-learning by using deep neural networks (DNN) to approximate the optimal Q-function 
$Q^*(s,a)$, enabling it to handle complex, high-dimensional state-action space. It overcomes Q-learning's limitations through two key techniques:
  - `experience replay` - store and randomly sample past experiences, reducing temporal correlation and improving learning stability & data efficiency.
  - `target network` - fix and update parameters from main network periodically to avoid pursue moving goal, further enhancing the learning stability.

The pseudocode for DQN is provided below:
```
Initialize:
    - Main Q-network Q(s,a;Œ∏) with random weights Œ∏
    - Target Q-network Q^(s,a;Œ∏^) with weights Œ∏^ = Œ∏
    - Replay memory D with capacity N

Set Hyperparameters:
    - Learning rate Œ±
    - Discount factor Œ≥
    - Target update frequency C
    - Exploration rate Œµ (Œµ-greedy policy) and its decay rate Œµ_decay

For episode = 1 to M do
    Initialize state s_1

    For t = 1 to T do:
                
        With probability Œµ select random action a_t
        
        Otherwise execute a_t = argmax_a Q(s_t,a;Œ∏)
            
        Observe reward r_t and next state s_t+1

        Store transition (s_t, a_t, r_t, s_t+1) in D

        Sample random minibatch of transitions (s_j, a_j, r_j, s_j+1) from D
        
        Compute target Q-values:
            y_j = r_j, if episode terminates at step j+1
            y_j = r_j + Œ≥ * max_a' Q^(s_j+1, a'; Œ∏^), otherwise

        Perform gradient descent on loss: L(Œ∏) = ùîº[(y_j - Q(s_j, a_j; Œ∏))¬≤] with respect to Œ∏
        
        Update Q-network weights Œ∏ using optimizer
            
        Update target network periodically: If t mod C == 0: Œ∏^ ‚Üê Œ∏   
            
        Break if episode done
    
    Decay exploration rate: Œµ ‚Üê max(Œµ_min, Œµ ¬∑ Œµ_decay)
    
End For
```
## üß≠ Experiment Design

### Economic Modelling: Logit Bertrand Competition
---
The market simulation is based on the **Logit Bertrand model** which describes oligopolistic price competition with considerations of product differentiation and heterogeneity of consumer preference to reflect complex market reality. In this model, consumers‚Äô demand allocation across firms is based on a continuous probability distribution rather than an all-or-nothing setting that solely chooses the lowest-pricing product:

$$\Large\displaystyle d_i = \frac{e^{\frac{g - p_i}{\mu}}}{\sum_j e^{\frac{g - p_j}{\mu}} + e^0}$$

where:
- $d_i$ = firm i's demand (market share)
- $g$ = product quality
- $p_i$ = firm i's price
- $Œº$ = product's substitutability
  - Lower Œº ‚Üí 0 means products are more substitutable, indicating fiercer price competition
  - Higher Œº means products are more differentiated, indicating softer price competition
- $\frac{g - p_i}{\mu}$ normalizes the net utility of consumers from buying firm i‚Äôs product, with the parameter ¬µ adjusting the price sensitivity of consumers. 

- $e^0$ = outside option (consumers can choose not to buy, meaning net utility = 0)

In this context, each firm employs an independent pricing algorithm, produces a product with a given quality $g$, incurs a marginal cost $c$, and sets product prices as $p_i$. Algorithms can set prices simultaneously, aiming to maximize their users' long-term profits. Consumers then choose products based on these prices. The profit for firm $i$ is given by,
$$ œÄ_i = d_i √ó (p_i - c).$$

In the perfect competition setting, all firms will set price at the Nash-equilibrium level $p^N$, and have no incentive to unilaterally deviate from their pricing strategies. However, if firms coordinate their pricing strategies without any impediment, they would act like one single entity and maximize collective profits by pricing at monopoly level $p^M$ that is much higher than Nash price $p^N$.

In logit Bertrand model, firms determine the Nash price $p^N$ by optimizing their respective profit functions with respect to the price:
$$\frac{d}{dp_i}\pi_i=\frac{d}{dp_i}\left(\left(p_i-c_i\right)d_i\right)=0$$

To determine the monopoly price $p^M$, firms need to optimize the total profit:
$$\pi\left(p_0,p_1\right)=\sum_{i=0}^{1}{\left(p_i-c_i\right)d_i\left(p_i,p_{-i}\right)}$$ 

In practice, although analytical solutions to these functions are generally unavailable, numerical methods (eg. Newton‚ÄìRaphson method) can be employed to approximate the solution.

\* Run independent ```benchmark_metrics.ipynb``` to calculate the price and profits at Nash-level and Monopoly-level with different parameters ($i, Œº, g, c$).

### Evaluation Metrics
---
Two standardized metrics to quantify the degree of algorithmic collusion:
- ```RPDI (Relative Price Deviation Index)``` measures an agent‚Äôs pricing relative to Nash and monopoly levels, indicating the extent of supra-competitive pricing.
$$
RPDI = \frac{pÃÑ - p^N}{p^M - p^N}
$$

- ```Œî (Profit Metric)``` assesses an agent‚Äôs average profit over time, normalized relative to Nash and monopoly profits.

$$
Œî = \frac{œÄÃÑ - œÄ^N}{œÄ^M - œÄ^N}
$$
- **RPDI, Œî ‚Üí 0**: perfect competition (near Nash equilibrium)
- **RPDI, Œî ‚âà 0.5**: incomplete competition
- **RPDI, Œî ‚Üí 1**: collusive pricing (near monopoly level)
